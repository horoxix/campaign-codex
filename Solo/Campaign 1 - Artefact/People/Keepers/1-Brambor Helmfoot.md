## **Type:**

A Folk Hero

## Description:
---
Brambor is as honest as they come, a local former of glow shrooms, he was not one to seek adventure nor fights.

## Finding [[The Artefact]]:
---
When a group of goblins, many riding wargs attacked his small village of [[Kraggen]], he knew nothing other than the overwhelming desire to protect the innocent that he loved in his own simple way. He wasn't simple in mind, only in want. You see, Brambor desired nothing more than to wed his childhood sweetheart, [[Helena Longsteps]].

I, [[The Artefact]], was wrapped in a mighty leather cloth, resting against the mantle when Brambor rushed inside his home, looking for something to defend his farm with.

My creator, the great [[Aronus Longsteps]] was Brambor's brother-in-law-to-be, currently traveling to the capital of [[Targgsvord]] to bestow me upon the prince of all dwarven kind for his coming of age day.

Brambor reached in the fireplace for an iron poker, but bumped into me, and with a long thought and a gentle nudge by yours truly, he lifted my magnificent self and rushed out to fight.

He wielded me with such righteous fury that day, and I knew that I had found the one truly meant to wield me.

Even so, Helena was slain that day. Brambor, having no reason left to stay, took me and joined the military, in attempt to get strong and never lose someone again. Aronus encouraged it, as he knew of my loyalty and that I would take no other master while Brambor lived.

"I'll think of something to tell his majesty, off with you now." - [[Aronus Longsteps]]
