![[aronus.png|300]]
A legendary dwarven smith with confidence as long as his girth. Aronus has been forging world renown artifacts for the past two hundred years. Unfortunately for those seeking such riches, he keeps his forge hidden and well-guarded. If he deems you worthy, he will seek you out and offer to craft you something of your choosing.

The only time this wasn't the case was on royal decree, when the king of the dwarves demanded a mighty Warhammer to be forged for his son, the prince, when he was to come of age.

To avoid being exiled and to protect his family, Aronus obliged.
