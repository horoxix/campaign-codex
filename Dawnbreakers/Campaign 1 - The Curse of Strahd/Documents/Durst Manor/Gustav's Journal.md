* *Found in the Master Bedroom on the [[3. Third Floor]]* of [[Durst Manor]].

**704–Neyavr–3**  
The children’s laughter fills these halls. Elisabeth’s beauty graces every room. I am a fortunate man. Though the world outside grows darker, here within these walls I have built something eternal — a sanctuary for my family.

**704–Martavr–18**  
Elisabeth is restless at night. She says the house speaks. I try to comfort her, but she grows distant, her thoughts ever elsewhere. I tell myself it is only her nerves, but I see shadows in her eyes.

---

**704–Prylla–25**  
She asked me to aid her in a work I did not understand. She looked upon me with such certainty — how could I refuse her? I thought it harmless. A husband should support his wife. Should he not?

---

**704–Eyun–19**  
I heard the chanting. Gods forgive me, I heard it. And I did nothing. My hands are not clean. If evil has been loosed, it wears the fingerprints of us both.

---

**704–Eyul–12**  
I cannot sleep. The children’s eyes linger on me too long, as though they know. Do they know? Elisabeth assures me all is well, but she speaks as one bewitched. Perhaps she is. Perhaps we both are.

---

**704–Eyul–28**  
I looked for the love I once knew in Elisabeth’s eyes, but she gives me nothing but coldness now. In my weakness, I turned toward her who is kind to the children, soft of word, gentle of hand. I thought perhaps I might find in her some spark of what I have lost. But it is not there. My heart is ash.

---

**705–Hektavr–3**  
She came to me trembling. She carries my shame within her. A child. Another innocent to be bound to this cursed house. I wanted to comfort her, but what comfort can a ruined man give?

---

**705–Hektavr–9**  
There was a moment tonight when I thought I saw Elisabeth — not my wife, but something else that wore her shape. She smiled as though she had won some terrible game. I have unleashed something I cannot master.

---

**705–Sintavr–14**  
I walk the halls like a ghost already. Shame gnaws at me; I cannot meet my children’s gaze. The nursemaid’s eyes are filled with quiet pleading, yet I cannot bear to look at her either. Every path I have taken leads only deeper into ruin.

---

**705–Ottyavr–2**  
I hear them in the dark. I try to shut my ears but the house hums with their voices. Elisabeth listens gladly. I cower. I would flee if not for the children, but where could I take them? Who would forgive me for what I have done?

---

**705–Ottyavr–18**  
It is too late. Too late for me, too late for them. Whatever door Elisabeth has opened cannot be closed. I write these words as confession, but I doubt the gods will read them. Shame is my only companion now.
