## Description

The younger brother of [[Rosavalda Durst]], Thorne starved to death alongside his sister while their parents, [[Gustav Durst|Gustav Durst]] and [[Elisabeth Durst|Elisabeth Durst]] left them locked in the attic.

Thorne is too young to realize what's going on and doesn't know that he's dead, but suspects it, even if he doesn't understand what that means.

Thorne doesn't trust anyone but his big sister, as every parental figure in his life has been cruel to him.
