## Info
* Lived as a woodsman guide.
* Prefers a simple quiet life in the forest.
* Life changed when unearthed a very special sword called [[Claiomh Solais]].
	* This sword appears with a masterfully crafted hilt, a gem in the center of it. The worn and regular looking blade attached to the hilt seems dull in comparison.

## Feats
* Sliced off the head of a [[Zombie Wolf]] in the first ever fight that the party engaged in.
* Brutalized a [[Ghoul]] when his Sword responded, glowing brightly and warm at the hilt.

## Character Arc
* While fighting [[Ghoul]]s in [[5. Basement 1]] of [[Durst Manor]], the hilt of his sword began to glow with raw power.
* Finally resting at the campsite, outside of the ruins of [[Durst Manor]], Andres had the following dream:
	* *A snow-swept gravel road climbs the mountainside, taking you to the foot of a massive temple-like structure. You see your sword resting against an entrance column, the old dirty stone imbued with veins of Amber.*
