**Name:** Claiomh Solais
**Origins:** Unknown

## Description
A legendary sword, unearthed by [[Andres Gaal]] while exploring the western forests of the Sword Coast. The weapon has an extravagant and beautiful hilt, encrusted by a gem of perfect cut and shape. The blade, however, is dull and ordinary, a stark contrast.

The weapon has an unknown origin, however since acquiring it, Andres has received visitations in his dreams by the sword in the form of emotions and visions. It led him to [[Daggerford]] and eventually into [[Durst Manor]].

The sword seems to reaffirm to Andres that he is following the right path, though he knows not yet why or what awaits him.
