![[durst-manor.png]]

A house owned by [[Gustav Durst|Gustav Durst]]Â and [[Elisabeth Durst|Elisabeth Durst]].

Durst Manor, once a home for a wealthy and renowned family, eventually fell to the Dark Powers, enticed by [[Elisabeth Durst]] in the search for immortality. She hosted parties where her fellow cultists would attend and perform human sacrifices, feeding their remains to a giant [[Flesh Mound]], her husband's bastard son [[Walter Durst]].

Those faithful to the cult, throughout the centuries have led wanderers and adventurers to the manor's steps in attempts to provide more sustenance for the Beast.
