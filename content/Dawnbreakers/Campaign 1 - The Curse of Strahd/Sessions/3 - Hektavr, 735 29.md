The players, after burying [[Rosavalda Durst]], [[Thornboldt Durst]] and the remains of [[Walter Durst]] decide to make camp and rest, mentally and physically.

[[Luther]] plays melancholy tunes, eyes glazed over looking into the fire as [[Andres Gaal]] and [[Zelraen Nightbreeze]] attempt to get some rest, while [[Belladonna Kolyana]] takes first watch. During this watch, she encounters a potential enemy, watching them and after a scuffle, kills him. But, instead of alerting the party, she sinks her vampiric fangs into his neck and drains him of his blood. It's been a long time since she has had anything other than the blood of forest animals and has a hard time controlling herself.

[[Cucur]], never having to fully sleep, is suspicious as Belladonna, claiming first watch, goes into her tent and doesn't reappear. He heads over to the tent and is surprised to find her walking forward in a robe, claiming she was trying to clean herself in a nearby water source. Cucur doesn't press the issue, but is keeping an eye out on her.

[[Zelraen Nightbreeze]] takes the next watch. Also curious about the nearby ruins, he walks along them, only stopping to see some drops of blood, his Drow eyes not mistaking them even in the dim, moonless night.

He follows the trail and finds a body, drained of blood, a familiar web pattern embroidered on his cloak. As he lifts the cloak he sees another Drow, like him. Is this Drow here for him? Has Loth tracked him to a land he himself didn't even know? He finds a map of [[Dawnbreakers/Campaign 1 - The Curse of Strahd/Locations/Barovia/index|Barovia]] in the cloak, with the words smeared in blood "Go Back", written on it.

The next morning the party leaves and follows the only real path westward, coming to a massive stone wall, two headless statues on either edge of a rusty iron gate that opens on its own with a powerful screech as they approach it. Though they look for someone, or something who could have opened it, they find none and the [[Gates of Barovia]] close behind them.

Shortly after, [[Cucur]] feels Death in the air, his Druidic powers doing their best to gain purchase in Barovia. They follow the thought and come to two massive wolves, tearing apart a corpse, with an imposing figure's back to them, watching.

He tilts his head slightly, a smirk upon his lips as the party approaches. The wolves stop what they are doing and stand beside him, ignoring their primal nature to continue feasting or attack the party and instead stand at ready with their apparent master.

>"Welcome to my land, I am Count Strahd Von Zarovich," [[Dawnbreakers/Campaign 1 - The Curse of Strahd/People/NPCs/Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd Von Zarovich]] says to the party, as he looks at them in turn. 

He approaches them, the sheer weight of his presence pressing down until they can do nothing but sit, helpless beneath his gaze. It is as though Strahd peers beyond flesh and fear, seeing into the very marrow of their souls.

>"You've brought an interesting sword to my land," he tells [[Andres Gaal]].
"Your siblings will be elated to see you," he informs [[Cucur]].
"When is the last time you've seen your wife and child?" he asks [[Luther]].
"Another of the dark-elves. The shadows grow crowded with your kin of late." he tells [[Zelraen Nightbreeze]].

Lastly he steps up to [[Belladonna Kolyana]] and lifts her chin in his hands.

>"Welcome home," he says to her.

He steps back and takes one last look at them. 

>“It truly is a tragedy,” he says, his voice like silk over ice—smooth, but cold to the core. 

He then sends his wolves away and turns into a swarm of bats, flying off into the valley.

The party gathers their wits and eventually reach the crest of the valley, exiting the trees at last, seeing a small, dirty looking village beneath them.

Before approaching the village, they decide to attempt and clean the muck and blood off of them from the nearby river, which fortunately is crystal clear, if cold. Cucur notices a raven watching them and the party has to keep [[Luther]] from staring at [[Belladonna Kolyana]] while she washes.

As clean as possible, they approach the village, entering its muddy, cobblestone streets. They see a woman pushing a cart and wave her over. She introduces herself as [[Granny]] and offers them free pies, as well as directions to lodging, at the [[Blood of the Vine Tavern]]. Luther takes a pie and the party heads to the tavern, watching Granny knock on another door, making her rounds.

The people look up at them as they enter with minimal interest, even seeing a Drow and a Harvestborn, quickly returning to their solemn drinks and food.

[[Arik the Barkeep]] barely looks up from washing his glasses and the party approaches, trying to ask him info, but is interrupted by [[Alenka]], the owner of the tavern. He is Vistani and the party asks him questions while his wife [[Mirabel]] and daughter [[Sorvia]] look for space for them to sleep. He informs them that he doesn't know a Madam Eva, but that there are some other Vistani camping just outside of the city and recommends they look there. He tells them also that a large amount of Barovians are soulless, the trapped land not having enough souls to go around and that Arik is one of them. Mirabel comes back with news that they have enough room for about half of the party.

When Alenka mentions that Strahd has been infatuated with [[Ireena]] over at the [[Burgomaster's Mansion]], Belladonna immediately stands up and goes to leave.

Luther and Andres decide to eat pies and enjoy the hospitality, Belladonna, Cucur and Zelraen head to the mansion.

They find a disturbing sight.

Every window and door boarded up, the outer gate barricaded with makeshift wooden braces, and the plants and shrubbery smashed to the earth as if stepped on. They hear shouting and head to the side of the mansion to find [[Ismark]] arguing with a helmed and armored man.

The man is telling Ismark to retrieve Ireena for him. Ismark, sword drawn is arguing and telling him to begone, that he will never have his sister. The party intervenes as the man leaves, smiling and unfazed, telling Ismark that Strahd always gets what he wants.

Just then, the ground erupts as [[Zombie|corpses]] ascend and attack the party, more of Strahd's [[Dire Wolf|Dire Wolves]] exiting the trees and surrounding the party.

Ismark, swinging an impressive longsword attacks one of the Zombies, while Zelraen, using steady aim, provides precise support. Cucur, hands raised, lifts the surrounding vines and roots from the ground to entangle the other two Zombies. The party uses a cantrip to let Luther and Andres know that they are needed, who immediately, bellies full of pie, head out of the tavern and rush to the manor.

**Belladonna** darts forward, slashing before retreating, but a zombie’s cleaver catches her side. Gritting her teeth, she scales the manor’s wall with unnatural grace. The others stare in shock, but there’s no time to question it as the wolves close in.

One Dire Wolf slams into Zelraen, pinning him down, its fangs inches from his face. Belladonna, climbing higher, hears a woman scream from inside.

>“Ireena!” shouts Ismark. 

With a roar, he drives his sword through the wolf attacking Zelraen, then hauls him to his feet.

At that moment, **Luther** and **Andres** arrive, colliding with another charging wolf. They struggle against the beast’s sheer size but manage to hold it back—helped, to their surprise, by **[[Lancelot]]**, who has followed them and now bravely snaps at the creature’s legs.

Cucur raises a hand and completely obliterates the previously entangled Zombie before it could reach him. Belladonna shoots Eldritch blasts from above. 

Suddenly, two **[[Skeleton]]s** claw their way up from the dirt behind Ismark and Luther. Luther narrowly avoids the strike, while Ismark is saved by Belladonna’s blast, which explodes the skeleton into a scatter of bone and dust.

Another scream echoes from within. Belladonna peers through a shattered window and sees only chaos—books and furniture strewn across the floor.

>“Follow me!” Ismark yells, charging toward the door. 

The party follows him inside, weaving through a once-elegant but now battle-worn home. Torn drapes, cracked portraits, and bloodied floorboards tell the story of long nights under siege.

They race up the stairs and burst into a bedchamber.

There sits **Ireena**, trembling on her bed, clutching a dagger. Her auburn hair falls wild about her shoulders, and the boards that once covered her window lie splintered on the floor.

Outside, suspended in the air, **Strahd** watches her.

> “Let me in, Tatyana,” he says softly. “It is only a matter of time. Why delay the inevitable?”

Belladonna charges forward, firing an Eldritch Blast. Strahd raises a hand—barely a motion—and the magic scatters harmlessly to ash.

> “There are always others,” he says, eyes fixed on her. “Others who will invite me in, Tatyana.”

> “I have all the time in the world.”

With that, his form dissolves into a cloud of bats, vanishing into the dark sky toward Castle Ravenloft.

Inside the room, silence falls. Belladonna convinces Ireena to lower the dagger. Ismark rushes to her side. In the confusion, they realize something impossible—Ireena and Belladonna share a bond deeper than coincidence. Each insists the other is mistaken: one calls Ireena her sister, the other denies it.

But there will be time for answers later. For now, they must regroup, re-barricade the manor, and rest.

For Ismark has need of their help.
