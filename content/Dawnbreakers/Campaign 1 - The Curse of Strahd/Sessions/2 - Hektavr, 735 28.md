The adventurers ready themselves to descend the hidden staircase and into the depths of [[Durst Manor]]. They speak with [[Rosavalda Durst]] who decides to accompany them, not wanting to remain alone in the room of her imprisonment. The party realizes that by bringing the children's bones with them, they can prevent [[Cucur]] from getting weaker due to his possession by [[Thornboldt Durst]].

Below they find many crypts, all empty, some engraved with the names of the Durst Family. [[Belladonna Kolyana]] asks if they would like their remains buried here and they decline, saying that they would prefer to leave this house forever, to see the sky again as she had promised Thorne.

The party come to what looks like a dining room of sorts, decaying and moldy bones lining the floors as well as a pyramid shape stacked on the table, pointing towards a small alcove in the corner. 

[[Zelraen Nightbreeze]] doesn't think twice and investigates.

A massive, slithering [[Grick]] falls from the ceiling on top of him, slamming into Zelraen with powerful tentacles, bloodying him immediately.

Zelraen disengages, flipping back onto the table and firing a direct hit from his short bow into the neck of the Grick.

[[Belladonna Kolyana]], having just learned the ways of Eldritch Blast, attempts it on the Grick and annihilates it with a mighty beam of crackling energy.

The party continues on, finding what appears to be sleeping quarters. Next each bed is a chest containing useful items of various shapes and sizes. [[Luther]], in particular, finds a journal of rotten black leather, [[Drasha's Journal]], detailing the cult's interactions with their victims, eventually leading to their demise being fed to [[Walter Durst]]

The party realizes that Walter is not just a missing baby, but somehow is being fed people as well?

Rose and Thorne do not know what to make of this information, but insist their brother Walter is still crying and needs help.

As they continue on, [[Cucur]] enters a narrow hallway and is ambushed by a set of three [[Ghoul]]s, chittering along the floor and repeating things such as;

> "Pretty... so pretty..."

>"Young. Always young!"

> "Immortal... We are immortal..."

The fight is intense. Zelraen shows off his athletics by running, sliding beneath one of the Ghouls and stabbing his daggers into its back, dealing massive damage.

Luther causes confusion as he shows insults and calls them names.

Cucur utilizes his spores, infecting and damaging the ghouls.

[[Andres Gaal]] stomps on one and stabs his blade down through the Ghoul's neck.

Cucur slices off the head of the final ghoul with his Scythe, uttering; 

>"*Not so immortal now, are you?*"

After the battle, they regroup and heal before continuing to explore the dungeon.

Luther and Andres find what appears to be a bedroom for the head cultists. Luther investigates a footlocker and finds lots of useful items. He surmises that they were from adventurers who had the unfortunate fate of finding themselves imprisoned here beneath [[Durst Manor]]. Upon grabbing a set of Thieves Tools, two [[Ghast]]s appear and attack, resembling [[Elisabeth Durst]] and [[Gustav Durst]].

The Ghast of Gustav bites deeply into Luther's shoulder. From the hallway outside, Zelraen shoots an arrow, misses and hits Luther in his other shoulder.

Gustav knocks out Luther with his claws, sending the unconscious bard to the cold, dirty floor.

Andre's sword glows for the first time as he slices the Ghast of Gustav into pieces.

Cucur revives Luther. 

Zelraen shoots the ghast, this time a direct hit. 

Andres finishes it off by cutting off its arms and stomps its face in with his large boot.

They then loot, divvying up the spoils of the footlocker. They find [[Elisabeth's Note]] on the bedside table along with [[Elisabeth's Amber Shard]]

Rose is sad about father, happy about mother dying. She tells the party that mother was never kind to them, but father was, in his own way.

[[Belladonna Kolyana]] takes the time, with the help of the party, to drag and bury the remains of the parents in their named crypts. Thorne leaves Cucur's body to watch, but stays close by, hugging onto Cucur's long, spindly leg.

Luther gives a beautiful eulogy. Cucur shows rare emotion, rubs Thorne's head and says he's sorry.

The party continues downwards, finding the stairs to the next floor. They take a short rest, heal to the best of their ability but know time is of the essence and hurry on.

Below they find a room with rare and creepy trinkets, ignoring most of them. They find a prison cell with nothing but decayed bones and shackles, but then eventually head into a large room, the chanting shifting to "He is the Ancient, He is the Land".

The floor of the room is lined in two feet of water, surrounded by a walkway hugging the walls. In the center of the room is an altar, flesh tendrils squirming and wiggling around a small, baby shaped bundle.

In the far room, huddling in an alcove, is a massive blob of pulsating flesh.

The party approaches the altar. Zelraen moves right and Luther moves left, staying back. Cucur attempts to use the Amber Shard on the [[Flesh Mound]], believing it to be Walter, but it has no effect. Belladonna lifts the bundle to find a blood stained dagger, and is unable to clean the blood off of it. The party discusses obeying the chanting, which has resumed to the previous "One Must Die", by sacrificing [[Lancelot]], but Cucur punches the Flesh Mound before any decision can be made and, with a blood curling roar, the Flesh Mound attacks.

The Flesh Mound attacks Cucur multiple times, missing and deciding to just eat him. It Engulfs Cucur, who sees inside of the mound of limbs, bones, and blood, are the remains of Walter, crying but not alive.

Inside, Cucur uses the Amber Shard and commands Walter to spit him out. 

The party does everything in their power to defeat the Flesh Mound with varying success. Key tactical and precise attacks by Zelraen, alongside massive swings by Andres and Belladonna, eventually wear it down.

The Flesh Mound, in anger, reaches out to Engulf Belladonna, who with arms raised, embraces it and lets it happen.

Inside, she cannot breathe or move. She uses all of her remaining strength to raise her morning star in one arm and shove it upwards.

With a critical hit, she shoves the Morningstar straight up and through the Flesh Mound, ejecting and landing on her feet before it.

The mound roars and shifts, transforming and opening its massive maw, where the remains of Walter sit hanging by two threads of flesh, above and below, wailing.

The party, with quick thought, decides to free the remains of Walter from the evil creature. Andres successfully slices through the bottom thread, and Cucur, with just enough luck slices through the top thread and grabs the remains, pulling the baby backwards and out of the now destroyed body of flesh, which melted into the water below.

Without the spirit of the Flesh Mound holding the manor together, it began to crack, splinter, and fall apart. The party quickly gathered their things and ran. They encountered Gustav, who tried to convince them to stay and die. [[Belladonna Kolyana]] yelled at Gustav, who was emanating pure shame and let them pass. They went through a hidden trapdoor, right out the front door and into...

An unfamiliar land.

Instead of the streets of [[Daggerford]], they found a cold, overcast landscape of thick forests and rolling green hills, the colors not bright and vibrant, but muted as if sad.

Rose and Thorne say this is their home, and is His land, the land of Strahd.

After laying Rose, Thorne and Walter to rest outside, the adventurers decide to camp and regain their strength, finding some abandoned ruins nearby to pitch their bedrolls.

During that night, the adventurers level up to 3. Lancelot sleeps next to Belladonna.

Zelraen finds a corpse with a tattered map, with a name atop it...
