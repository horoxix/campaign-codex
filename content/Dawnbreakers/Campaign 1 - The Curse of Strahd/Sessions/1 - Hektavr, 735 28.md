It is the eve of the [[Highharvestide]] festival in [[Daggerford|Daggerford]], along the Sword Coast.

A dark carriage drops [[Belladonna Kolyana]] off out front of an old and abandoned looking manor. Her eyes are alight with purpose as she looks up at the rusty gate, squeaking in the wind.

[[Andres Gaal]] and [[Luther]] leave the Olivebranch Tavern, Luther having just won a few coins off of beating Andres in a drinking game. Andres didn't realize that Luther was drinking apple cider, and not the same liquor as himself. Luther, feeling bad, helps his new friend along the street as they come across the departing carriage and Belladonna.

[[Zelraen Nightbreeze]] appears just then, exiting a dark alleyway with a coin purse a few silvers heavier. Not knowing where to sleep in a city where all of the inns are full of visiting relatives and travelers, his attention is peaked by the small party growing in front of this manor.

[[Rosavalda Durst|Rosavalda Durst]] and [[Thornboldt Durst|Thornboldt Durst]] appear and ask for help. They can't find their brother [[Walter Durst|Walter Durst]]. He is in the house, crying, but they don't know where. They haven't seen their parents for ages. 

Before the party can enter and help the children, [[Cucur]] shows up, curious and decides to just follow along, his motivations unknown. It takes some convincing to allow the construct creature to join the party, but eventually they decide that they will keep an eye on him, and hurry into the [[Durst Manor|Durst Manor]].

Inside the house, on the [[1. First Floor]], the party explores, looking for where the children ran off to. They find a coat closet containing cloaks, a top hat, and a [[Party Invitation]]. They find a dinner with rotten, maggot infested food, which had originally appeared and smelled delicious. Luther almost helped himself, but was warned off by Cucur, revealing the rotten, maggot-infested feast before them.

They find a hunter's den and are attacked by three, rotten and decaying [[Zombie Wolf]]. Luther leaps onto the mantle above the fireplace and pummels the wolves with key blowgun shots. Andres and Zelraen sever legs and heads, only to find no blood on them but instead, the bodies disappeared into ash and mist. They dispatch the wolves with minimal harm to themselves.

Upon climbing the stairs to the [[2. Second Floor]], Cucur, having rushed ahead, is ambushed by an [[Animated Armor]], attempting to knock him down and over the ledge. It only partially succeeds and engages him on the steps. The rest of the party rushes up to help fight four suits of armor, which quickly surround Belladonna. Belladonna takes a massive swipe from one of their claws, dropping to drastically low health, but screams for more, fighting off attack after attack with her shield and armor, allowing the rest of the party to finish off the enchanted creatures.

Luther tried time and time again to knock into them with his sling, missing each time. Cucur tripped the stumbling suit of armor that had engaged him and it fell prone to the floor below. Luther lifted one of the ornamental spears and dropped it down, plunging into the chest plate and defeating the encounter. He played a victory tune on his lute.

On this floor, the party finds a library with tomes and books of all editions and subjects. They find a hidden room with a previous adventurer killed by poison dart traps. In this room Cucur finds tomes instructing the reader on dark fiend summoning rituals. They also find a conservatory with an emaciated dog, the nametag reading [[Lancelot]]. Belladonna calms the dog, feeds it, and decides to take it with them. Luther plays the harp.

They climb to the [[3. Third Floor]], ignoring a black plate suit of armor standing at the top and investigate the rooms.

The adventurers find the Master Suite, with a hanging [[Gustav Durst|Gustav Durst]], along with his suicide note. He is sorry for something. The players surmise that Gustav had an affair, and the child missing from the portrait on this floor is probably from that affair. They find [[Gustav's Journal]], as well as [[Elisabeth's Journal]].

Zelraen finds a supply closet with sheets, soap and a broom. Belladonna reaches for the broom and is attacked as it comes to life. They fight for a hilarious few minutes, until Belladonna grows tired and smashes the [[Broom of Animated Attack]] into pieces.

They also find a nursery, and the trapped spirit of [[Margaret]], the nursemaid, screaming at them to leave her baby alone. Cucur moves to attack, but Belladonna stops him and tries to reason with the spirit. The spirit calms and agrees to let them save her baby, Walter. When Belladonna lifts the bundle, it falls into a pile of cloth, nothing inside.

Margaret tells them that Rose and Thorne are in the [[4. Attic]]. She points towards a mirror that Elisabeth Durst used to use, and Zelraen finds a hidden door and staircase.

In the attic, they find a locked door. Cucur unlocks it with the iron key he found a few floors down and they find the remains of Rose and Thorne, along with a dollhouse matching the house they stood in exactly and a chest of toys. Upon inspecting the dollhouse, they can see all of the hidden passageways in the house, including one staircase that leads to the basement. Rose and Thorne appear, this time very much aware that they are dead. They do not want the party to leave them again, alone, locked and starving. Thorne possesses Cucur and Rose possesses Zelraen.

In a spare room, Belladonna finds a doll and Luther suggests they give it to Rose. Upon doing so, she leaves Zelraen and returns to her room.

The adventurers head towards the secret staircase, finding a burnt body inside of a furnace on the way. Upon opening the stair case, they level up and Cucur starts to feel sick and weak as the distance between Thorne's spirit within him, and Thorne's remains grow.
