## Description

The matriarch of the Durst family. Wife of [[Gustav Durst|Gustav Durst]] and mother of [[Rosavalda Durst|Rosavalda Durst]] and [[Thornboldt Durst|Thornboldt Durst]]. Seeing Her Lord's apparent immortality, Elisabeth founded a cult seeking the favor of the dark powers by worshiping of Strahd and performing cannibalistic rituals. She reached her goal when the Dark Powers saw her depravity after sacrificing the baby [[Walter Durst]] in the crypts beneath [[Durst Manor]]. This act drove [[Gustav Durst]] to take his own life, but Elisabeth and her fellow cultists were transformed into ghouls and ghasts, forever trapped in their perversion.
