## Description

The younger brother of [[Rosavalda Durst]] and [[Thornboldt Durst]], Walter was a bastard, born to [[Gustav Durst]] and [[Margaret]], the Durst Family nursemaid.

Originally, [[Elisabeth Durst]] was so preoccupied with her rituals to care, but eventually the resentment and anger grew that [[Gustav Durst]] was not supportive nor on board with what she was doing. So, she sacrificed Walter to the Dark Powers, finally achieving her goals of immortality, driving Gustav to take his own life out of despair.

While Elisabeth and her followers were reborn as Ghouls and Ghasts, Walter was reformed into a [[Flesh Mound]], a massive mound of undulating and twisting parts, made up of all that was fed to him. Dubbed the beast, all subsequent human sacrifices were then fed to Walter.

## Timeline
* **[[2 - Hektavr, 735 28]]**: The party, using [[Elisabeth's Amber Shard]] were able to keep the [[Flesh Mound]] at bay long enough to deal enough damage to open its maw, revealing the remains of Walter within its core, as the heart of the beast.
* **[[2 - Hektavr, 735 28]]**: [[Andres Gaal]] and [[Cucur]] cut the remains out of the maw, defeating the [[Flesh Mound]] that was using Walter's spirit and remains to live.
* **[[2 - Hektavr, 735 28]]**: Walter is peacefully laid to rest outside of the ruins of [[Durst Manor]] alongside his sister [[Rosavalda Durst]] and brother [[Thornboldt Durst]].
