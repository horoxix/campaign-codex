* Took the orb held in statue's palm, and convinced the shadows to let her.

## Character Arc
* She arrives at the rumored manor in Daggerford, the exact one she had been seeking.
* The land that they exited the ruins of [[Durst Manor]] feels... familiar to her. Almost like the feeling of coming home after a long journey rather than visiting a foreign land.
