* *Found in the Master Bedroom on the [[3. Third Floor]]* of [[Durst Manor]].

**704–Neyavr–15**  
The nights are too long. When the lamps die and Gustav finally sleeps, I hear it still — a hush in the walls, like a breath drawn and never released. He says the house is settling. I know it is watching.

**704–Martavr–2**  
I cannot stop thinking of time. It steals what is mine, though the children grow brighter each day. My face betrays me. There must be a way to keep what belongs to me.

**704–Prylla–21**  
The mirror lies. I saw myself, untouched by years, radiant as if time had never grazed me. I touched the glass and it rippled under my hand like water. She waits for me there.

**704–Eyun–10**  
The whispers return at night, but I never recall the words. Still, I wake with certainty: I am meant for more than the grave.

---

**704–Eyul–1**  
Sleep abandons me. I walk the halls until dawn, hearing the heartbeat in the walls. Sometimes it falters, as if to remind me how easily we break. But I need not break.

---

**705–Hektavr–27**  
The children laugh, but beneath it I hear something else. The house swallows their voices, leaves me with only echoes. Perhaps it is not the house that changes — perhaps it is I.

---

**705–Sintavr–9**  
The mirror mocks me now. Sometimes she smiles when I do not. Sometimes she lingers when I turn away. She is patient. She is waiting.

---

**705–Sintavr–28**  
Gustav does not understand. He is too small, too weak to grasp eternity. But I see it. Death is no ending, only a door. I will step through before it closes.

---

**705–Ottyavr–11**  
My hands tremble. The whispers are loud now — louder than my own thoughts. They say I am chosen. They say the key is mine.

_No night shall claim me. No dawn shall age me. I will remain._
