Hail thee of might and valour:

I, the Burgomaster of Barovia, send you honorâ€”with despair.

Too many have come to this cursed land, wandered ignorant into this nightmare realm, lost their lives and very souls, no more I say, no more!

This last year more than any in the last 400 we have suffered, the Village is bled dry and now even my own home and family are targeted by the Devil! My wits are ended and all thoughts of salvation lost....

So I say to you, give us up for dead and encircle this land with the symbols of good. Let holy men call upon their power that the devil may be contained within the walls of weeping Barovia. Leave our sorrows to our graves, and save the world from this evil fate of ours.

There is much wealth entrapped in this community. Return for your reward after we are all departed for a better life.

Kolyan Indirovich, Burgomaster
