* ***Oct 28 2408:*** The central nervous system of [[content/Mothership/Campaign 1 - Another Bug Hunt/Locations/Samsa VI/Greta Base/index|Greta Base]] and primary communication station for the Company. The crew finds destroyed equipment and the slumped over body of [[2ndLt Kaplan]], a revolver in one hand with 5 bullets left in the chamber, and a bloody hole in his head.
  
  They decide, rather than panicking, to rest, gather their bearings and have [[Unit 84-SP86 (Clanker)]] repair the communications array, taking 13 hours.
