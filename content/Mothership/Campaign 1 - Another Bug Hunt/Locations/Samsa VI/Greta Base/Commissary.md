* ***Oct 28 2408:*** From the [[Airlock]], the crew finds a ransacked mess hall and rec room, flickering lights, when on, highlight broken dinnerware, overturned tables, and destruction, everywhere. A "Happy Birthday Olsson" banner droops from the ceiling, where open bullet holes let in the untamed atmosphere and rain. Bullet casings, blood splatter, and large claw-like gouges in furniture highlight a woman's head, ripped at the neck.
  
  There is a makeshift barricade pushed up against the [[Crew Habitat]], where an upturned table, with cake splattered across the floor, reveals a protruding human arm. The crew lifts the table to see the same paper cuts across the headless corpses flesh. They surmise that the head belongs to this body, and see the dog tags of [[LCpl Xavier]].
