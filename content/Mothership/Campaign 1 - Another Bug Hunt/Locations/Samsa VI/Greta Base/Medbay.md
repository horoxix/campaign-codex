* ***Oct 28 2408:*** The crew finds the Medbay in disarray, and investigating a small bank of powered down computer terminals, find a [[Logbook]] written by [[Dr. Edem]]. With the help of [[Unit 84-SP86 (Clanker)]]'s [[Omni Company]] corporate keycard, they are able to enter the analysis lab and find some broken medical equipment, another lead container of [[Hydrofluoric Acid]], 4 large specimen containment tubes containing [[Carcinid]] larva, and a Carcinid limb behind an upturned surgical table.
	* [[Ephraim Commander]] tests the Acid on the limb, which thrashes and attempts to attack him, but he successfully jumps out of the way. The carapace melts instantly.
