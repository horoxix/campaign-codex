# Overview
---
**The Omni Company**, formally **Omni Systems Interstellar**, is one of the largest chartered conglomerates operating within the United Americas Corporate Zone and adjacent frontier sectors. With holdings spanning over 300 colonies and research installations, Omni maintains a near-monopoly on terraforming contracts, biosphere engineering, and frontier logistics.

In the outer systems, “**The Company**” is almost always assumed to mean Omni — a testament to its reach and the opacity of its subsidiaries. Its influence extends from cryo-freighter manufacturing to xeno-biochemical research and private military contracting. Most spacers encounter the Company through its subcontracting arms: anonymous, underfunded, and disturbingly efficient.

# Corporate Mission Statement
---
> _“To expand humanity’s reach beyond Sol through innovation, stewardship, and profitability.”_  
> — Executive Charter, Omni HQ Geneva Orbital

Behind the corporate gloss lies a simpler truth: **Omni goes where governments won’t, and profits where ethics don’t.** Their risk-management policies classify human life as an “expendable resource class.” Contractors sign long, dense NDAs that legally outlive them.

# Structure
---
- **Executive Directorate (ED):** The nominal leadership body based on Geneva Orbital. Directors rarely travel beyond the core worlds.
- **Omni Frontier Operations (OFO):** Coordinates missions in unregulated or high-risk zones. Most mercenary and exploration contracts originate here.
- **Omni Biotech Division (OBD):** Oversees biological research, terraforming seeds, and organismal weaponization. Officially “civilian use only.”
- **Omni Security Solutions (OSS):** A private enforcement and retrieval arm. OSS agents wear matte black hardsuits and carry blank IDs.
- **Omni Logistics & Recovery (OLR):** Handles salvage and containment operations, often arriving “after the incident” to sanitize sites.
- **Omni Synthetics Division (OSD):** Designs, deploys, and maintains the Company’s android workforce across its holdings. OSD operates under three mandates: utility, stability, and deniability.

Many colonies deal only with front companies or shell contractors, never realizing they’re funded by Omni capital.

# Corporate Culture
---
Employees are encouraged to “**think beyond limits**,” though dissent is met with immediate termination and psychological debrief. Most low-tier contractors never meet an Omni executive. Pay is automated. Instructions arrive via encrypted transmission.

Personnel colloquially refer to the Company as **“the God in orbit”** — omnipresent, unseen, and occasionally wrathful. Its slogans are omnipresent on colony walls, cargo crates, and stim-pack labels:

> - _Omni cares for your tomorrow._
> - _Safety is profit._
> - _Together, we make the void habitable._

# Public Reputation
---
Omni enjoys broad support among frontier colonies desperate for employment and supplies, yet public trust in the Core Systems is mixed. The **Frontier Press Union** has accused Omni of multiple ethics violations, including wage theft, cover-ups, and experimental testing without consent.

Despite this, Omni remains untouchable. Its insurance and shipping arms quietly bankroll half the known space lanes. Even rival corporations rely on Omni logistics to stay solvent.

# Notes for Field Personnel (Contractors’ Edition)
---
- Always follow Omni transmission protocols. Unauthorized communication may result in **contract forfeiture**.
- In case of biological or xeno-contact, **preserve samples** and **transmit telemetry** before evacuation.
- Any mention of “Omni retrieval teams” should be treated as an **immediate recall order**.
- Do **not** attempt to contact Omni HQ directly. The Company contacts you.

# Rumors & Conspiracies
---
- Some claim Omni’s **“ghost ships”** patrol derelict systems, scavenging tech decades ahead of known science.
- A persistent rumor suggests Omni’s leadership has long since **merged with synthetic intelligences**, rendering the “Directors” little more than avatars.
- Frontier priests whisper that Omni’s logo — a triple-ringed sun — mirrors an ancient alien sigil found on the dead world of Helix 9.

Of course, these are only rumors. The Company denies everything.
