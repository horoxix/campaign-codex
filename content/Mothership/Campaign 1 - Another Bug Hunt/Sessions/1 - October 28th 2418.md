The Crew, after having been hired by the [[Omni Company]], wakes from Cryosleep and is bombarded by [[Maas]] with instructions and a [[Job Dossier]] before they can even fully rub the cryo from their eyes.

[[Kael Starhopper]], a cargo driver and ex-marine rubs his pot belly, blinks heavily and shakes off the cobwebs. His usual route was running dry and the money would keep him steady until he could find a better run and maybe even help him tune-up his hauler.

[[Ephraim Commander]], having run into a bit of trouble as a current, but should-have-retired-already, marine, most security detail or missions were being handed to younger and more energetic folk. Experience wasn't given the reverence it used to.

[[Unit 84-SP86 (Clanker)]], boots up, not from a Sleepbed, but from an android docking station. Having been commissioned for the job to "fill a slot", as Maas so lovingly labeled it, Clanker would miss his previous assignment but also was excited for the prospect of adventure.

The mission was straightforward, with good pay and benefits. Kael had worked for the Omni Company before and they would follow through with the pay, even if begrudgingly.

They were to land on the tropical planet of [[Mothership/Campaign 1 - Another Bug Hunt/Locations/Samsa VI/index|Samsa VI]], a frontier planet currently being terraformed by the Omni Company for future habitation and luxury apartments. Even though the planet appeared lush and full of life, it was not yet breathable by humans. 

Once there, the crew had to navigate to [[Mothership/Campaign 1 - Another Bug Hunt/Locations/Samsa VI/Greta Base/index|Greta Base]], rendezvous with [[kaplan]], re-establish communications and get the Terraforming equipment back online. Communications had been shut off 6 months ago and they had received no word since then.

If all else fails, the crew was to retrieve key personnel. [[Dr. Edem]] and the Omni Company's synthetic science officer [[Hinton]].

Or, at the very least, the key piece of Hinton that they cared about, his Logic Core.

Orbiting Samsa VI in [[The Metamorphosis]], Kael barely has time to put in his hazard suit and find [[Tugger]] before the three of them are hurried onto a dropship, piloted by [[Ander]] and [[copilot]], and drop to the surface.

The shuttle, obviously not up to safety standards, no matter how much the Omni Company would guarantee it, shakes, rattles, and both Kael and Ephraim have to shake off the nerves, wondering if they will even live long enough to see the planet surface, let alone a paycheck. Clanker appears unconcerned, as they plummet to the surface through an increasingly fierce tropical storm.

Surprisingly, the landing is fairly smooth, and the crew finds themselves outside of the dropship, in torrential rain, on a muddy APC trail with water up to their ankles. Kael and Ephraim help Clanker along through the thick mud and eventually the team arrives at the front airlock for Great Base.

The lights are out, no systems running and everything is dark. They attempt to use the keypad, but the base's power is on power-saving mode. They knock, attempt to pull open the door and have no success so the crew decides to head around Greta Base and gather their bearings.

Kael peers through a window as they walk clockwise around the base and through the dim emergency lights is able to see a makeshift barricade between two rooms.

They continue around, pushing through the storm as it seems to come down even more furiously.

Eventually they come to the back garage doors, a large metal garage door closed. They find some vehicle parts such as a tire, a wrench, and a pile of mud that does not seem to be affected by the rain pummeling it.

Kael pushes the mud with the tip of his shotgun and discovers the body of a Marine, the dog tags reading [[corpse1]].

They attempt to open the garage door and are only able to crack the bottom, where they can hear a scratching, thudding sound coming from inside. They call out, but nothing answers them. The decide to take the wrench and try the airlock again.
