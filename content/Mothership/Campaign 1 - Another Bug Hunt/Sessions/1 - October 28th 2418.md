The Crew, after having been hired by the [[Omni Company]], wakes from Cryosleep and is bombarded by [[Maas]] with instructions and a [[Job Dossier]] before they can even fully rub the cryo from their eyes.

[[Kael Starhopper]], a cargo driver and ex-marine rubs his pot belly, blinks heavily and shakes off the cobwebs. His usual route was running dry and the money would keep him steady until he could find a better run and maybe even help him tune-up his hauler.

[[Ephraim Commander]], having run into a bit of trouble as a current, but should-have-retired-already, marine, most security detail or missions were being handed to younger and more energetic folk. Experience wasn't given the reverence it used to.

[[Unit 84-SP86 (Clanker)]], boots up, not from a Sleepbed, but from an android docking station. Having been commissioned for the job to "fill a slot", as Maas so lovingly labeled it, Clanker would miss his previous assignment but also was excited for the prospect of adventure.

The mission was straightforward, with good pay and benefits. Kael had worked for the Omni Company before and they would follow through with the pay, even if begrudgingly.

They were to land on the tropical planet of [[Mothership/Campaign 1 - Another Bug Hunt/Locations/Samsa VI/index|Samsa VI]], a frontier planet currently being terraformed by the Omni Company for future habitation and luxury apartments. Even though the planet appeared lush and full of life, it was not yet breathable by humans. 

Once there, the crew had to navigate to [[Mothership/Campaign 1 - Another Bug Hunt/Locations/Samsa VI/Greta Base/index|Greta Base]], rendezvous with [[2ndLt Kaplan]], re-establish communications and get the Terraforming equipment back online. Communications had been shut off 6 months ago and they had received no word since then.

If all else fails, the crew was to retrieve key personnel. [[Dr. Edem]] and the Omni Company's synthetic science officer [[Hinton]].

Or, at the very least, the key piece of Hinton that they cared about, his Logic Core.

Orbiting Samsa VI in [[The Metamorphosis]], Kael barely has time to put in his hazard suit and find [[Tugger]] before the three of them are hurried onto a dropship, piloted by [[Anders]] and [[Renfield]], and drop to the surface.

The shuttle, obviously not up to safety standards, no matter how much the Omni Company would guarantee it, shakes, rattles, and both Kael and Ephraim have to shake off the nerves, wondering if they will even live long enough to see the planet surface, let alone a paycheck. Clanker appears unconcerned, as they plummet to the surface through an increasingly fierce tropical storm.

Surprisingly, the landing is fairly smooth, and the crew finds themselves outside of the dropship, in torrential rain, on a muddy APC trail with water up to their ankles. Kael and Ephraim help Clanker along through the thick mud and after about half an hour the team arrives at the front [[Airlock]] for [[content/Mothership/Campaign 1 - Another Bug Hunt/Locations/Samsa VI/Greta Base/index|Greta Base]].

The lights are out, no systems running and everything is dark. They attempt to use the keypad, but the base's power is on power-saving mode. They knock, attempt to pull open the door and have no success so the crew decides to head around Greta Base and gather their bearings.

Kael peers through a window as they walk clockwise around the base and through the dim emergency lights is able to see a makeshift barricade between two rooms.

They continue around, pushing through the storm as it seems to come down even more furiously.

Eventually they come to the back garage doors, a large metal [[Garage]] door closed. They find some vehicle parts such as a tire, a wrench, and a pile of mud that does not seem to be affected by the rain pummeling it.

Kael pushes the mud with the tip of his shotgun and discovers the body of a Marine, the dog tags reading [[PFC Olsson]].

They attempt to open the [[Garage]] door and are only able to crack the bottom, where they can hear a scratching, thudding sound coming from inside. They call out, but nobody answers them. They decide to take the wrench and try the airlock again.

After another long trudge through the mud, the trio successfully opens the Airlock by hammering the rusty hinges and using the wrench as a lever to force the door outward. They Greta Base, finding only the emergency backup lights on, and silence save for the distant sound coming from the garage.

Inside the Airlock, they find some pulse rifle ammo and a rosary, which [[Unit 84-SP86 (Clanker)]] puts on. The are unable to open the inner airlock door whilst the exterior remains open, so they have to hold the exterior door closed while the interior door is opened, which proves successful.

Inside they find the [[Commissary]], a ransacked mess hall and rec room, flickering lights, when on, highlight broken dinnerware, overturned tables, and destruction, everywhere. A "Happy Birthday Olsson" banner droops from the ceiling, where open bullet holes let in the untamed atmosphere and rain. Bullet casings, blood splatter, and large claw-like gouges in furniture highlight a woman's head, ripped at the neck. There is a makeshift barricade pushed up against the [[Crew Habitat]], that they ignore for now.

Before continuing further, they decide to check out the [[Pantry]], finding nothing but empty shelves and piles of MREs grouped on the floor, as well as the slumped over body of a marine, the dog tags reading [[2ndLt Lange]], odd paper cuts crisscrossing her skin.

Kael breaks into an adjacent [[Freezer]], using tools and about 10 minutes, and finds the corpse of a frozen marine, wearing a tinfoil hat and clutching a frozen tumbler of [[Hydrofluoric Acid]], his dog tags reading [[LCpl Resnick]].  [[Kael Starhopper]] takes the tumbler and nearly faints as the marine's hand falls off at his feet. They also find a medical case containing frozen chemotherapeutic agents, but decide to leave it in the freezer.

They backtrack into the [[Commissary]] and decide to head to the [[Command Center]] to look for [[2ndLt Kaplan]], when they see an upturned table, with cake splattered across the floor, revealing a protruding human arm. The crew lifts the table to see the same paper cuts across the headless corpses flesh. They surmise that the head belongs to the previously discovered decapitated body, and see the dog tags of [[LCpl Xavier]].

In the [[Command Center]], they find destroyed equipment and the slumped over body of [[2ndLt Kaplan]], a revolver in one hand with 5 bullets left in the chamber, and a bloody hole in his head. They decide, rather than panicking, to rest, gather their bearings and have [[Unit 84-SP86 (Clanker)]] repair the communications array, which would take 13 hours.

Kael and Ephraim, not wanting to wait the entire time, grow bored and decide to head for the [[Medbay]]. Inside they find a wall of powered off computers, and overturned surgical tables, with documents scattered across the floor. They return with an [[Omni Company]] keycard, courtesy of Clanker, and open the Analysis Lab, finding a [[Logbook]] written by [[Dr. Edem]], excited at the discovery of something they call the "krebslieder", or "crabsong", a shrill Shriek the [[Carcinid]]s use in order to replicate. Edem begrudgingly admits that [[Hinton]] did much of the legwork, but it was her who truly "put two and two together".

They also find another lead container of [[Hydrofluoric Acid]], as well as some larvae of [[Carcinid]] in tubes. Before leaving, Ephraim lifts one of the overturned surgical tables to find a severed arm, covered in black carapace armor. Kael and Ephraim take turns attempting to shoot the armor, but their bullets just bounce off of the thick hide. Ephraim tests the acid on the arm, which immediately thrashes at him. His marine instincts kick in, and he dodges out of the way, happy to now know that the acid melts straight through the carapace, revealing the meaty flesh beneath.

Next, they head to the [[Crew Habitat]] to do some investigating.  Unfortunately the comms cut out and they can't communicate with [[Unit 84-SP86 (Clanker)]] who remains behind to continue the repairs.

As they reach the entrance, they take a few minutes to remove the makeshift barricade and see, spray painted on the entrance wall, the words "COMMS OFF!". They immediately try to reach Clanker to see if they should stop repairing the communication system, but decide to quickly investigate the rest of the quarters before returning, as they still had plenty of time.

Inside the quarters, they find the rooms and bunks of the entire Greta Base crew. Along with various vices and supplies, they find, in [[2ndLt Kaplan]]'s office, a locked dresser door. They also find, in [[Dr. Edem]]'s office, [[Olsson's Birthday Card]] with some interesting communication between the two.

They return to [[Unit 84-SP86 (Clanker)]] and inform him of the writing on the wall, as well as asking him to check Kaplan's corpse for a key, which he does find in Kaplan's front shirt pocket. They decide that the crew quarters are a good place to rest up and prepare, while Clanker agrees to finish the communication repairs but not to activate them yet, just in case.

Kael and Ephraim return to the quarters, and use the key on Kaplan's desk, finding a [[Locator Device]] which Clanker believes must be for [[Hinton]] as it matches the standard company synthetic being tracker that he himself has somewhere.

After getting some sleep, they meet up and check the [[Armory]], entering a blasted-off door and finding what was once a well stocked supply of weapons and ammunition, nothing more than a melted pile of metal. 

With the comm system repaired, and the mission gone to hell, the crew decide to investigate the [[Garage]], the source of the only sound they have been hearing this entire time, the scratching and clawing. They first divvy up some [[Hydrofluoric Acid]] by using what few glass containers they could find in-tact in the [[Commissary]]

Inside the Garage, they encounter a strange scene. 

There is an APC vehicle to one side, and a massive hole to the other. The sounds are coming from inside this hole. 

They also notice a tool bench covered with various useful items, six barrels of fuel and a backup generator.

An offline powerline hangs next to the edge of the hole.

Kael enters the APC and finds [[Demar]] inside, thin and malnourished, covered in papercuts, rocking back in forth saying things such as :
* *I want to go back. I want to go back to the hive.*
* *I can hear them, they are calling me. I want to contribute.*
* *They will wake, they are awakening*

He was clutching a live grenade, which [[Kael Starhopper]] and [[Ephraim Commander]] expertly and efficiently snatched from him without blowing themselves up. They put him in the corner of the room where he continued to mumble to himself, but Ephraim now had to hold onto the grenade as there wasn't a safe place to dispose of it. Kael turns on the APC lights, lightening up the garage.

[[Kael Starhopper]] turns on the power generator, using one barrel of fuel, and adding another to the APC.

[[Unit 84-SP86 (Clanker)]] investigates the hole and inside discovers a marine, covered in filth and dirt, hands bloody, digging furiously in the ground, deep in muddy water.

They try and call to the marine, but he doesn't respond nor make any sort of indication that he hears them.

Clanker jumps in and attempts to pull the marine out of the hole. The second his synthetic hands touch the marine's shoulder, a massive pair of black, carapace covered [[Carcinid]] arms rip themselves out of the marine's flesh and claw at [[Unit 84-SP86 (Clanker)]], smashing his hazard suit helmet and slicing a massive claw mark down his chest.

Clanker attempts to fight back, pouring [[Hydrofluoric Acid]] down the newly formed hole, melting carapace and flesh, but is stopped abruptly as [[Kael Starhopper]] tosses the now-live power line into the waterhole, sending shockwaves of electricity through the creature and through Clanker, knocking both the marine's host body and Clanker's android body unconscious.

Kael and Ephraim get to cover. They begin firing at the creature. Kael's ex-marine training kicks in and he rails the [[Carcinid]] with powerful bullets to the face. [[Ephraim Commander]] blasts the hole with his SMG but is unable to find much success as the gun was not meant to be held in a single hand, the kick-back too much to worry about while focusing on holding the grenade tightly.

The Carcinid began to pull itself out of the lifeless marine host, climbing up out of the hole with Clanker in it's crab-like arms, looking at the Garage door and an escape into the forest.

Just as it reached the edge of the hole, Clanker's system rebooted and he regained consciousness, lifting his revolver and firing a shot into the bottom of the Carcinid's jaw, killing the alien creature and ending the first scenario.
